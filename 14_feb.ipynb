    "Multithreading in Python\n",
    "What is Multithreading?\n",
    "Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads (smaller units of a process) within a single process. It allows for multiple operations to be performed simultaneously within a single application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it Used?\n",
    "Multithreading is used to improve the performance of applications by allowing multiple threads to run in parallel. It is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks, such as reading from a file or making network requests, as these tasks can be performed while other operations continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Module Used\n",
    "The module used to handle threads in Python is called the threading module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use the Threading Module?\n",
    "The threading module is used because it provides a high-level interface for working with threads. It allows for easy creation, control, and management of threads in a Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions of the Threading Module\n",
    "activeCount()\n",
    "Use: Returns the number of Thread objects currently alive.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",

    "Deadlocks and Race Conditions\n",
    "Deadlocks:\n",
    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other. This usually happens when two threads have a circular dependency on a pair of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Conditions:\n",
    "A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and try to change it at the same time. The outcome depends on the non-deterministic ordering of thread execution, leading to unpredictable results.\n",
